      <p>Hello there, I'm Robert from Nsawam, Ghana. A BYUi student. I'm still offering web and Computer Programming. I find swimming and riding a big fun.
        I also enjoy caribean songs as i find the Patoan Language very intriguing. I intend o one day go on a visit to spend sometime in Jamaica not necessarily
        to learn the language, but to listen to most espercially the girls speak it fluently. For me, i think its practically impossible to learn and know by heart 
        except by the gift of tongues.

      <p>With over 32 million inhabitants, Ghana is the second-most populous country in West Africa, after Nigeria. The capital and largest city is Accra
        in addition to being known for its lush forests, diverse animal life, and miles of sandy beaches along a picturesque coast, Ghana is also celebrated for its rich history—its habitation possibly dating from 10,000 bce—and as a fascinating repository of cultural heritage.
